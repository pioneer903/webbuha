					<h2>Dorothy Phillips </h2>
					<h3>Print &amp; Web Designer</h3>
					<p>Life without design is like a world without art for this gifted designer.</p>
					<p>After graduating from Maryland Institute College of Art with a certificate in graphic design, 
						Dorothy Phillips continued to fine tune her craft by freelancing in the Baltimore area.</p>
					<p>After working at a standard 9-to-5 in the payment services department of Bank of America during her college years, 
						Dorothy couldn't stomach the thought of working somewhere that wouldn't allow her the creative freedom she craved.</p>
					<p>After toying with the thought of designing on her own, Dorothy came across MOS Creative. 
						The unique atmosphere that would allow her creative freedom over her designs are what initially drew her in, 
						and the exciting projects and constant challenges to top her last design are what has kept her around as lead graphic designer for almost three years now.</p>

					<h2>Tony Celano</h2>
					<h3>Animator &amp; Designer</h3>
					<p>This homegrown "Bawdamorian" couldn't get enough of cartoons as a child, and decided once he grew up to create some of his own.
					   Tony Celano began animating in 2001 by teaching himself on Adobe Flash. 
					   While at UMBC he studied animation and graphic design, perfecting his skills and opening him up to a whole new variety of software, artistic styles and mediums.
					</p>
					<p>Unlike most young professionals, Celano's career began his sophomore year of college. While at a house party, 
						Celano was wowed with his new friend's animation work. Instead of just showing off, his buddy invited him to check out his office. 
						Flash forward 10 minutes and Celano was the newest addition to the MOS Creative team.
					</p>					
					<p>That was in 2007, and he's still heading all of the creative animation and graphic design work at MOS. 
						Whether busy designing a new launch page or creating awesome cartoons of his co-workers (see artwork above),
						Celano is always eager to put his unique spin on whatever project lies ahead.

					</p>
					<p>After completing one year at UMBC studying computer science, Parker knew that he would learn more outside of the classroom, 
						where he'd be free to take in information at lightning speed.
						Continuing to teach himself through online tutorials and veritable libraries of technical reading, 
						Parker set out to test his web development knowledge on an agency level. Since being hired at MOS Creative as one half of the development team, 
						Parker has never given any other industry a second thought.

					<p>Building websites and software for a variety of unique clients, Parker is efficient in almost every platform known to man. 
						If he comes across something new, just give him an hour and he'll have already added it to his list of talents.
