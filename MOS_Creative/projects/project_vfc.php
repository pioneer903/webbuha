					<span class="bolded"> Challenge: </span> 
					Vehicles for Change is a nonprofit organization that facilitates the donation of cars to families with financial challenges. The company did not have a mobile presence when mobile traffic in general was growing on an annual basis. They also were not receiving their full potential of leads and conversions, and did not have enough data to fully evaluate what their cost per car was for advertising online. 
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Goal: </span>To conduct research to further understand the competitive online space and adjust campaigns accordingly. Ultimately, the goal was to increase donations, which would result in a lower cost per car for the donation program. Another goal was to run a search engine marketing campaign utilizing display, Facebook, AdWords, Bing and any other channels that become relevant.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Result: </span>
					We were able to have Vehicles for Change approved for the Google Grants Program, which gave them $10,000 in monthly Adwords credits. Since our efforts, donations have grown from an average of 4 vehicles per month to an average of 20 vehicles per month while maintaining a profitable cost per acquisition.
