					<span class="bolded"> Type of work: </span>  Web Design and Development.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Challenge: </span>Edward Arthur Jewelry had a website that was too long in the making, and did not accurately depict them as the established and trustworthy high quality jeweler that they are.</p>
				
				<p><span class="bolded">Goal:</span>To create a modern, attractive and easily accessible site that clients could utilize for shopping and planning their big events. Key was designing an intuitive user experience. On the back end, our goal was to create a custom admin dashboard that would make it easy for the Marketing Director to update and stay current on their product stock and any events they wished to promote.</p>
				
				
				<p><span class="bolded"> Result: </span> MOS was able to finish an updated, visually appealing and functional site for the client within 45 business days. One highlight was a custom, interactive infographic to help site visitors understand the “4 C’s of Diamonds” in order to make an educated investment.				</p>
