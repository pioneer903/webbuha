					<span class="bolded"> Type of work: </span>  Web Design and Development.

				<p><span class="bolded"> Challenge: </span>Green JobWorks, a longtime partner of ours, had an issue with lead generation and their mobile site. They are a construction staffing company and needed a mobile campaign that would get people interested and bring in new leads to their site.</p>
				
				<p><span class="bolded">Goal:</span>To create a mobile site to tie into their broader marketing initiatives. We needed to develop a tool for them that would not only provide value to visitors, but also pull in leads for the business.</p>
				
				
				<p><span class="bolded"> Result: </span>We developed an integrated marketing tool for Green JobWorks. A QR code on their print material took visitors to a mobile site, which had a custom tool on it that let users calculate their hiring costs within the Green JobWorks program. This was helpful for visitors as they gained more knowledge and understanding of what Green JobWorks could do for them. The other benefit was that this tool captured information that would lead nurturing from Green JobWorks.
