				<p>
					<span class="bolded"> Challenge: </span>
					 Mosaic Power was one of the first companies to pioneer the technology for controlling energy usage of water heaters in order to 
					 conserve energy based on a consumer’s power grid. 
					 The level of technical detail and the fact that it was a developing industry posed a challenge for consumers to understand the company’s services.  
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Goal: </span>To create a template website that helps visitors to more easily understand the company’s services on a basic level.
					An animation video was also created to help describe Mosaic Power’s energy-saving technology. Other priorities included brochures, a logo redesign, a trade show display, 
					and a business card design.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Results: </span>  
					We successfully created a clean, direct website that enhanced clarity about the company, 
					along with a video animation that assisted with explaining Mosaic Power’s service.
					Feedback revealed that many consumers did not understand what Mosaic offered until they watched the animation.
