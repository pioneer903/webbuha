					<span class="bolded"> Type of work: </span>  Web Design and Development.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolded"> Challenge: </span>North Point Builders had many issues with their website. The logins were scattered about, it was hard to keep projects updated and visible, and they lacked the flexibility to manage their site as their company grew. Without this flexibility, it was difficult for them to show clients what they were capable of.
Additionally, they needed a website redesign to differentiate them from “just another construction company” and show their full capability to build, design, and manage projects from the ground up.
</p>
				
				<p><span class="bolded">Goal:</span>To address North Point Builders’ web management issues, we needed to find a way to build an intuitive database that could manage all of their projects and content. Site visitors would be able to see all of the company’s current projects, industries they work in, and locations they serve.
On the front end of things, we needed to build them a modern website which would effectively showcase their portfolio of work and their modern approach to the industry.
</p>
				
				
				<p><span class="bolded"> Result: </span>North Point Builders’ new website is contemporary, flexible, and modular—allowing them to truly showcase their modern approach to their industry. One highlight is their interactive project map, where site visitors can see what North Point Builders have built by industry and region, all from one interactive map.
