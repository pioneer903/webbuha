    bio: [
        'For over five years, Max Kryzhanovskiy, president of MOS, has been <b>consulting clients and helping them structure their marketing</b> needs to reach company goals and develop a credible brand.<br/><br/> Max has helped to strategically build and develop company brands in order to create long term growth and expansion for top industry leaders. He believes that <b>simplicity and "less is more," are the best ways</b> for a consumer to digest the concept that is being offered and make them want to share it with others.<br/><br/> Although he understands the drive and vision of smaller businesses, Kryzhanovskiy has also worked with larger companies that gross more than $10,000,000 annually. He believes that one of the most important aspects of his job is <b>realizing what\'s next on the horizon</b> before his competitors.<br/><br/> Keeping up to date with <b>new technology, advertising and marketing trends,</b> these are all part of his daily routine to help his clients grow to proportions beyond their imagination.',
        '<b>Shawn Haley is officially inspired</b>. But he wasn\'t always the super optimist that he is today. When Haley graduated from Elizabethtown College in 2007 with a degree in Marketing and Information systems, he was unsure where his next step would be.<br/><br/> In an effort to stay productive, Haley took a job in retail sales. When four years flashed by leaving Haley with nothing to show for it, he knew it was time to move on.<br/><br/> With an eye closely fixed on the prize, Haley began his adventure at MOS as a humble Account Executive, and has worked his way up the ranks to VP of Business Development.<br/><br/> Haley smiles every time he thinks about how MOS has helped him get back to what he refers to as <b>his "roots" - networking, marketing, design, photography</b> - everything that he had foolishly been deprived of for years.<br/><br/> Haley has worked with a variety of clients in almost every industry, managing new client projects and advising them on <b>the best marketing and advertising techniques for their company</b>.',
        'Organization, resourcefulness and management come naturally to Baltimore County native Colleen Stanley. A "Jill" of all trades, Colleen has dual degrees in Visual Communications and Management. Her business management and design knowledge allocate the edge needed to provide exemplary service.<br/><br/>On completing her dual degrees from Salisbury University, Colleen was eager to learn the inner workings of an agency. A few searches (and pull from a friend) she landed her job with MOS.',
        '<b>Marketing is not Matt Milligan\'s only passion.</b> A thirst and desire for the arts have crafted his technique for creative approaches to solving problems. It seems fit that he progressed into the communications industry with years of marketing experience for corporate, non-profit and government contracting companies.<br/><br/> Looking for a change of pace, <b>Matt came to MOS eager to work in a creative atmosphere.</b> His background and resourcefulness have assisted in polishing MOS\'s SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and SEM (Search Engine Marketing) efforts.<br/><br/> <b>Matt thrives on learning new and upcoming tactics</b> to provide excellent service to clients, ensuring they stand out.',
        '<b>This copy editing wizard spent her formative years majoring in Business Communication</b> at Stevenson University. It was there that Ally Levin focused all of her efforts on advancing her career in the field of journalism and creative writing.<br/><br/> She began reporting for <i>The Villager</i>, Stevenson\'s campus newspaper, and honed in on the <b>professional copy editing skills that define her today.</b><br/><br/> In her junior year, Ally was given the opportunity to study abroad and intern at Prospect Pictures, a television production company in the United Kingdom. Simultaneously working in the creative and the communications departments, Levin gained experience <b>leading creative group meetings and managing highly intelligent databases</b>.<br/><br/> Once home, her newly acquired skills made her <b>the perfect fit for <i>The Villager\'s</i> Editor in Chief</b>. While acting as EIC her senior year, Levin also began interning at MOS Creative.<br/><br/> After graduation, Levin was overjoyed by the opportunity to continue working with the company as full time <b>leading copy editor.</b>',
        '<b>Life without design is like a world without art</b> for this gifted designer.<br/><br/> After graduating from Maryland Institute College of Art with a certificate in graphic design, Dorothy Phillips continued to fine tune her craft by freelancing in the Baltimore area.<br/><br/> After working at a standard 9-to-5 in the payment services department of Bank of America during her college years, Dorothy couldn\'t stomach the thought of working somewhere that wouldn\'t <b>allow her the creative freedom she craved</b>.<br/><br/> After toying with the thought of designing on her own, Dorothy came across MOS Creative. The unique atmosphere that would allow her creative freedom over her designs are what initially drew her in, and the exciting projects and <b>constant challenges to top her last design</b> are what has kept her around as lead graphic designer for almost three years now.',
        '<b>This homegrown "Bawdamorian" couldn\'t get enough of cartoons as a child,</b> and decided once he grew up to create some of his own.<br/><br/> Tony Celano began animating in 2001 by teaching himself on Adobe Flash. <b>While at UMBC he studied animation and graphic design</b>, perfecting his skills and opening him up to a whole new variety of software, artistic styles and mediums.<br/><br/> Unlike most young professionals, Celano\'s career began his sophomore year of college. While at a house party, Celano was wowed with his new friend\'s animation work. Instead of just showing off, his buddy invited him to check out his office. <b>Flash forward 10 minutes and Celano was the newest addition</b> to the MOS Creative team.<br/><br/> <b>It\'s been five years, and he\'s still heading all of the creative animation and graphic design work</b> at MOS. Whether busy designing a new launch page, or creating superhero cartoons of all of his co-workers, Celano is always eager to put his unique spin on whatever project lies ahead.',
        'Growing up, John always had a passion for art; however, he never considered it a realistic career option until attending college.<br/><br/>While attending Harding University in Arkansas, John discovered the field of graphic design. He received his B.A. in Advertising with an emphasis on Art and Design in 2010 and afterwards moved back to Maryland to start work as a Graphic Artist.<br/><br/>Flash forward 2 years and John is now a part of the MOS team as one of our top Graphic Designers. He uses his skills to create visually compelling work that serves its purpose and inspires viewers. He particularly enjoys creating brand identities for clients. For these projects he incorporates clean well thought out design and typography and creates more than just logo but an entire brand identity centered on the art.',
        '<b>Greg Parker is part super hero, part coding whiz kid.</b><br/><br/> It was his job in the hospitality industry during his adolescent years that kept Parker from spending all of his time toiling away on his computer studying code. <br/><br/>After completing one year at UMBC studying computer science, Parker knew that he would learn more outside of the classroom, where he\'d be <b>free to take in information at lightning speed.</b><br/><br/> Continuing to teach himself through online tutorials and veritable libraries of technical reading, Parker set out to test his web development knowledge on an agency level. Since being hired at MOS Creative as one half of the development team, Parker has <b>never given any other industry a second thought.</b><br/><br/> Building websites and software for a variety of unique clients, <b>Parker is efficient in almost every platform known to man.</b> If he comes across something new, just give him an hour and he\'ll have already added it to his list of talents.'
